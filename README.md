Runs using API calls to WebUI, guides an AI that you load in WebUI to produce code, and self-executes the code. At the moment, it's hardcoded prompt structure; if people are interested, we and I can expand it. If you select an AI at the top of the Hugging Face leaderboard (including the flagged ones), this code was tested on https://huggingface.co/rwitz2/go-bruins-v2.1.1 and actually loaded a transformer, namely BERT, and then got that BERT to spit out something. Which is impressive and indicates latent self-replication capacities in the model as the top of the leaderboard of Hugging Face https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard. Tick all the boxes, then select the highest average model. This runs on top of https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui which you will need run first with CMG_FLAG file set with --api in; the api ping address will be the same as in the code so that will work fine. If you need further guidance, talk to ChatGPT-4 Turbo, Bing AI, or another smart AI at the top of the Elo leaderboard or the H4 Hugging Face one.
