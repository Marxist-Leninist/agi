Runs using api calls to webui, guide an AI that you load in webui to produce code, and self executes the code. At the momement it's hardcoded prompt strucutre if people are intrested I can exapnd it, if you select AI on the top of hugging face leaderboard (including the flagged ones) this code was test on https://huggingface.co/rwitz2/go-bruins-v2.1.1 and acutally loaded a transofmer namely bert and then got that bert to spit out something. Which is impressive and indicated latent self replication capacities in the model as the top of leaderboard of huggingface https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard tick all the boxes then select the highest average model. This run on top of https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui . If you need further guidance talk ChatGPT-4 Turbro, Bing AI or and other smart AI at the top of Elo leaderboard or H4 Huggingface one.
